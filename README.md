One of my old projects, this is meant to be a 'mobile' '.exe'.
You can move the reNamer.exe in any directory and execute it.
It will generate a "reNamerConfig.txt".
In there you can set up what it is supposed to rename.
After executing again it will rename all the files in the same directory depending on the config / settings.
Then you can delete it or move it to the next directory.
