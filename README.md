#Introduction

One of my old projects, this is meant to be a 'mobile' '.exe'.

You can move the reNamer.exe in any directory and execute it.

It will generate a "reNamerConfig.txt".

In there you can set up what it is supposed to rename.

After executing again it will rename all the files in the same directory depending on the config / settings.

Then you can delete it or move it to the next directory.

#using/changing it

If you trust me you can run the .exe from this repo, if not you can re-compile the code.

If you want to change the settings permanently, they are set in the constructor of reNamer.
